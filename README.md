# Defending Chef: Karens Counterattack
#### Project carried out within the scope of the introduction to computer graphics course
In the world of popular culture and social media, the term "Karen" has become widely recognized as a reference to a stereotype of a person known for their demanding, arrogant and often irritating behavior. "Karens" are portrayed as people who frequently become involved in conflict situations, usually in service environments such as restaurants, stores and other commercial establishments.
This 3D game takes place in a restaurant and portrays a chef who got tired of all the complaints from the “Karens” and decided to turn to violence. The player controls the chef (with the WASD keys) and throws kitchen rolls (with the space key) to gain points, but if he hits calm and understanding customers, he loses points.
